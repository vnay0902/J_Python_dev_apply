Question:Design and implement a simple read-only ORM that works with CSV files. 
The ORM should support list and get queries. 
Assume that the CSV file has a column called ID that is unique to every row. 
If you got this far, as an added bonus, add filtering functionality that takes a column name and a matching value (no need to implement partial or fuzzy matches). 
Please do not use any off shelf third party libraries other than Flask to handle queries. 
Everything you need for this is in the Python standard library.
